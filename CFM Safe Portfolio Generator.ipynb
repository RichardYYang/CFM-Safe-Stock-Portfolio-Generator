    "Volatility maps how much a stock deviates over a certain period. The stocks that have lower volatility deviate less. The less a stock deviates, the safer it is. The reason volatility has such a high weighting in our overall score is because of its ability to weed out the riskiest stocks from our portfolio by assigning them a low score. We were also aiming to find a balance between volatility in the short-term and long-term. The pandemic has had a major impact on stock prices over the last 2 years, which is why we also wanted to look at historical data over the last 10 years to get a bigger picture. That is why our final volatility calculates a weighted average of the volatility over the last 2 years, worth 25%, and the volatility over the last 10 years, worth 75% of the final volatility.  \n",

    "Sharpe ratio is a way to measure how much return an investor can get per unit of risk. It takes both the average return and standard deviation into account. This allows us to look at whether the stock is worth buying. One potential dilemma with the sharpe ratio is that a stock with a low return and volatility has the same sharpe ratio as a stock with a high return and high volatility. Since we are trying to build a portfolio of safe stocks, it is important that we get rid of most stocks with high volatilities. In our portfolio, we can do this by giving standard deviation a high weighting, allowing it to weed out the riskiest of stocks. Once again, in order to get a balance between sharpe ratio in the short-term and sharpe ratio in the long term, we calculated mean return using a weighted average of the return over the last 2 years, worth 25%, and the return over the last 10 years, worth 75%.  \n",

    "We choose stocks which have high covariance with S&P 500. This is to find stocks that basically follow the market trend. That means the stocks do not have high non-systematic risk. Since the market index like S&P 500 normally has low volatility, stocks chosen based on this criterion will be safe.  \n",

    "Moving Price Average: \n",
    "\n",
    "Weight: 5% \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for looking at the Two Hundred Moving Price Average is simply to get another indicator to see how safe the stock is. The closer a stock is to its moving price average, the more likely that it is a safer stock as it likely deviates less than other, more riskier stocks. Of course, a really risky stock could just happen to be very close to its moving price average; however, when combined with other indicators such as volatility and covariance, moving price average is a good way of finding safe stocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to use a variety of indicators such as volatility, sharpe ratio, covariance with the S&P 500 index, and moving price average. In addition, the data used to calculate many of these indicators aimed to strike a balance between the short-term stock history and long-term stock history. This helps to diversify our indicators and allows us to pick better stocks. Say for example, a stock gets a poor correlation with the S&P 500. If other factors such as volatility and moving price average show that the stock is safe, then it has a high chance of still being included in our portfolio. We decided the weights for each indicator based on how well each indicator can predict how safe a stock is. Multiple portfolios have been generated using different weights for the indicators, and this was found to be the optimal weighting. "
